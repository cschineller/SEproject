Hey guys, so I created this notes file to let everyone know about progress 
on the project so far. Maybe we can  write down everything we change /add on 
this document so we have a record, more than just git commits. -Gabe

Gabe:
  -Created Models
  -Created Views
  -Created Controllers
  -CUCUMBER 
  -RSPEC

Callie:
  -Started adding to the routes file
  -Did styling to header (pink background is just temporary)
  -Having issues getting the + button vertically centered (once we decide on a color I will adjust its color
   and make the background transparent)

Jake:
  -Did the initial setup
  -Debugged gems
  -Got app up to heroku: https://obscure-wildwood-85273.herokuapp.com/ 

What still needs to be done so far 
  1. There is a lot more that needs to be done, but one easy thing is that I did half of the crud_spec
  tests, and created a framework for someone else to finish it if they don't know what else to do.
