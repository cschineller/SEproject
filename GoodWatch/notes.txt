Hey guys, so I created this notes file to let everyone know about progress 
on the project so far. Maybe we can  write down everything we change /add on 
this document so we have a record, more than just git commits. -Gabe

Gabe:
  -Created Models
  -Created Views
  -Created Controllers

Callie:
  -Started adding to the routes file

Jake:
  -Did the initial setup
  -Debugged gems
  -Got app up to heroku: https://obscure-wildwood-85273.herokuapp.com/ 

What still needs to be done so far 
  1. RSPEC  AND CUCUMBER <-- IMPORTANT
  1. Do the routes
  2. Debug my code
  3. Seed the program
