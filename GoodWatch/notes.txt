Hey guys, so I created this notes file to let everyone know about progress 
on the project so far. Maybe we can  write down everything we change /add on 
this document so we have a record, more than just git commits.

Gabe:
  -Created Models
  -Created Views
  -Created Controllers

What still needs to be done so far at the top of my mind is to 
  1. Do the routes
  2. Debug my code
  3. Seed the program
